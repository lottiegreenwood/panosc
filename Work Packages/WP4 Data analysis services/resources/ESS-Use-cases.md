# PaNOSC WP4 use cases at ESS

## Mantid / Sci++

Mantid is a framework for analysing and reducing neutron scattering and muon spectroscopy data.
It is usually used through a GUI, but also offers a python API.

sci++ is a collection of libraries for handling multi-dimensional data arrays with labeled dimensions, starting as an offshoot from Mantid. Intended to handle cases xarray does not cover sufficiently, such as handling of neutron scattering data, handling of physical units, propagation of uncertainties, support for event data.

## Sasmodels / Sasview
Sasmodels/Sasview are two parts of a small angle scattering analysis application for the analysis of 1D and 2D data directly in inverse space. 
Sasview is the GUI frontend, and sasmodels refers to the backend, which can be accessed via python API, shown [here](https://github.com/SasView/documents/tree/master/Meetings/User_Meeting_2018)

## McStas 
McStas is a tool for simulating neutron scattering instruments and experiments. McStas is centered around a DSL instrument file (the McStas meta language) which can be translated in to a C file by the McStas code generator. A new prototype for an API that allow interaction with McStas through an interface like Jupyter Notebooks is created under WP5 of PaNOSC. For this use case, we would plan on running the python code in a jupyter notebook directly, but have the actual Mcstas instrument simulation (the McStas application) running on a cluster backend.
